 # Web3Hack

Welcome to the **Web3Hack** project! In this repository, I will be sharing my Proof of Concept (PoC) code for various web3 hacks, as well as exploring the potential of alternative attack scenarios. This project will be regularly updated with new code and insights, so be sure to check back often for the latest updates.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on exploring the security aspects of web3 applications and decentralized systems. By sharing PoC code and discussing potential attack vectors, I aim to contribute to the community's understanding of security challenges in the web3 space.


## How to Use

To explore the contents of this project:

1. **Browse the Code:** Take a look at the PoC code provided in the repository. Keep in mind that these are demonstrations of potential vulnerabilities â€“ do not use them maliciously.

2. **Explore Attack Scenarios:** Check out the discussions on alternative attack scenarios. This will give you a broader perspective on web3 security challenges.

3. **Read the Writeups:** For a comprehensive understanding of each hack, read the detailed writeups available on [my blog](https://dappopia.hashnode.dev/). These writeups provide insights into the attack methods and suggest ways to protect against them.
